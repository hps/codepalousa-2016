# Code PaLOUsa 2016

This is an end-to-end example project used to demo the patent-pending SecureSubmit tokenization library offered by Heartland
at the 2016 Code PaLOUsa conference.

The card information fields and the submit button of the payment form are dynamically injected iframes pointing to fields hosted
on Heartland's payment gateway, keeping you (the integrator, merchant, etc.) eligible for the PCI SAQ-A compliance form.

A demo of iframe-hybrid tokenization only can be found on [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Heartland/L00kgsvr).

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, and load the solution in Visual Studio.

Run the project from Visual Studio to walk through the execution.
